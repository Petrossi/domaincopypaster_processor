This is the best way to check if a website is down because you'll know almost immediately whether the site is going to be down. If it's down, there is no point in having it live on the web at that moment. You would be losing money and customers! If none of these solutions work, you may need to check with your hosting provider. If they aren't upgrading their servers, you may want to consider moving your site somewhere else. Luckily, most major hosting companies are very reliable and are able to quickly and easily keep their servers up and running. If the problem is on one of their servers, they usually fix the problem very quickly. If your site isn't on one of their servers, you'll just have to make the decision of whether or not you're willing to move on.</p>
